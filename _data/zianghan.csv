In the Abyss... sheening... weathering,"Han, Ziang",11/16/2021,Quartet-Music,English,"<<In the Abyss... sheening... weathering...>> is inspired by one of my recent composition for tuba and saxophone---<<Gazing at Ephemerality in My Broken Shadow>> I was intrigued by the colorful possibility of sound articulated from tuba played in the Voxman concert hall, so I want to write something for it. I originally planned to write for 3 tubas, but as I know more people from music school, I decide to change it to 2 tubas (John Reyna the tuba student, John Manning the tuba professor) 1 prepared piano and mezzo soprano (Ghadeer Abaido and Kelly Hill, they are friend) These 3 types of instruments seem separate, but I use a lot of techniques that is very “echoing” to make them into a whole. Imagine if you are sitting on the floor of a deep unknown ocean where the historically distanced and unrelated artifacts are presented in front of you because of the unceasing currents, and they are emanating this light sheen. It is so delicate as if it will go away after your next blink, but it will keep weathering and become part of the ocean over a long time. The text is from Kelly Hill’s favorite recitatives in multiple languages, but it’s not related to my sound (music) at all as if it is another entity trying to blend with the other 3 in this abyss.","Han, Ziang",In the Abyss... sheening... weathering... - Full Score.pdf,306kb,.pdf

Switch,"Han, Ziang",4/20/2022,trio-Music,English,"Switch is written for Kenken Gorder, Sarah Hetrick and Will Yager for their residency at the University of Iowa in March/2022. In this composition, I draw upon one of the gestures from my most recent composition <<I saw you crumble in the mirror>> for solo cello--- a static, long airy sound emerges right at the moment that a short, loud and percussive sound is articulated. This metaphorical switch is working like an anchor constantly opening and closing different gates that lead to some possibilities among infinite others.","Han, Ziang",switch.pdf,198kb,.pdf

Wandering On the Border of Infinities,"Han, Ziang",2/19/2023,String Quartet-Music,English,"Wandering on the Border of Infinities - This composition is inspired by the construction of a string instrument itself. I imagine the bridge as a metaphorical border, a place that cannot be confined within time or space, filled with mysterious air. As you are wandering around it (above or below the bridge), unknown and strange fields start to emerge and disappear. Sometimes you just look at them from afar, sometimes you find one that is very tempting, and you walk into it….","Han, Ziang",Han-Wandering on the Border of Infinities.pdf,289kb,.pdf

"Ionized Vision, Vaporized Light","Han, Ziang",2/22/2024,Wind Ensmeble-Music,English,"Ionized Vision, Vaporized Light is about an imagined gigantic and boundless creature who only has access to its optic sensation. The creature is otherwise trapped inside something amorphous, borderless, and invisible. The strong attack at the very beginning, and throughout the piece, represents the loud and metallic clanking sound made by its eyelids as the creature blinks. Each time it blinks, its surroundings crumble down a bit, slowly disintegrating from inside, ionized in the end. Over time, those ionized particles merge with each other and the light, ascending into another space, vaporized.","Han, Ziang","Ionized Vision, Vaporized Light - Full Score.pdf",424kb,.pdf
